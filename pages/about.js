                                Every time you start playing, a random word will be selected from a list of ~1000 most
                                common english words.

                                If the word contains multiples of the same letter and the letter is guessed, all the
                                occurrences of the letter will be filled.

                    <h2>Vision</h2>
                    <p>
                        The vision of the project was to make a simple game, where player can compete against each other.
                        The game needed to be simple, since there was only two and a half weeks time to get the project
                        ready. As the game I decided to make a Hangman game, since it was relatively simple to make
                        and can be addicting. I also wanted a theme for the website and decided to go with a space theme.
                        The name "Blank Horizons" was derived from the blank spaces which need to be filled in the
                        Hangman game and from a planets horizon. Originally it was planned to place the blank spaces
                        along a planets horizon, but it proved hard to achieve.
